# Real-Time-Gender-and-Age-Detection
# Introduction
In this project I showed that by learning representations through the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), a significant increase in performance can be obtained on these tasks. To this end, I used a simple convolutional net architecture that can be used even when the amount of learning data is limited. I evaluated my model on the recent UTKFace dataset for age, race and gender estimation and show how it dramatically outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

# Methodology
Data Collection:
-Utilize the UTKFace dataset, which contains a large number of facial images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity information. -Preprocess the images to ensure uniformity in size, lighting conditions, and facial orientation.

Model Architecture:
-Design a simple yet effective convolutional neural network architecture tailored for age and gender detection tasks. -Train the model using the collected dataset, employing techniques such as data augmentation to enhance generalization.

Model Evaluation:
-Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set from the UTKFace dataset. -Measure performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both age and gender predictions.

Comparison with Existing Methods:
-Compare the performance of the proposed model with state-of-the-art methods for age and gender detection. -Highlight the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness.
